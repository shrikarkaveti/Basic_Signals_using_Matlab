# Basic Signals using Matlab

This repository contains Matlab code for generating and analyzing fundamental signals, along with implementations of key signal processing operations.

## Contents

This repository includes Matlab implementations and demonstrations of the following:

1.  **Basic Signal Generation:**
    -   Unit Step Signal
    -   Impulse (Dirac) Signal
    -   Parabolic Signal
    -   Ramp Signal
    -   Rectangular Signal
    -   Signum Signal
    -   Triangular Signal
    -   Sinusoidal Signal
    -   Exponential Signal
    -   Sinc Signal (unnormalized)
    -   Sampling Signal (normalized sinc signal)

2.  **Convolution of Signals:**
    -   Continuous Convolution (implemented with and without Matlab's built-in `conv` function, as well as custom functions)
    -   Discrete Convolution

3.  **Fourier Transform:**
    -   Performed on signals with and without Matlab's built-in `fft` function, including custom implementations.

4.  **Z Transform:**
    -   Implementation of the Z Transform on signals.

5.  **Signal Sampling:**
    -   Demonstrates the concept of sampling signals at various sampling rates.

The **`Print`** folder contains PDF documents showcasing the results (plots, outputs) of all the generated signals and the corresponding Matlab codes used.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Matlab installed.
2.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3.  Open Matlab and navigate to the repository's directory.
4.  You can run the individual `.m` files to generate and analyze specific signals or explore the convolution, Fourier Transform, Z Transform, and sampling examples.
5.  Refer to the PDF files in the **`Print`** folder to see the output and the associated code for each signal and operation.

## Repository Structure

-   `.m` files in the root directory: Contain the Matlab scripts for signal generation and processing.
-   `Print/`: Contains PDF files with results and code for each signal and operation.
