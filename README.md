1. Using Matlab to generate basic signals (Eg. Unit Step Signal, Ramp Signal, Parabolic Signal)
2. Performing Convolution of Signals (Continuous Convolution (with and without built-in and custom functions, Discrete Convolution) 
3. Performing Fourier Transform on Signals (with and without built-in and custom functions, Discrete Convolution) 
4. Performing Z Transform on Signals
5. Sampling Signals at different sampling rates to understand sampling concept
